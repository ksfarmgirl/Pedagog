# Pedagog
CIS 642 Project

The goal of this Pedogogial Preview Extension is to provide lower level coders with a
 visualization of the errors in their code. To do this debug information is gathered 
 and presented to the user in a second, required, preview window. The preview window will 
 display the react app once that functionality is added.

React proto-type

To run the react app as of now you have to cd into the my-app folder then run npm install, and
after that you have to run npm start which will open the basic react webpage. The webpage as of now
is a space to test and prototype components.

Python Tutor Extraction proto-type

In order to run our extension launch a debug window using the Launch Extension option
 in the debug menu then activate the debug readme.md option from the debug menu. A 
 Webview should apear on the right in the second window. 

The extension.js file is our most heavily edited file as it holds our Webview and extension checking.

Licensing

The liscensing for the base extension we set-up is there in the .ts files under src. It is 
also there in the AREPL code we have brought in for the backend of our program.
