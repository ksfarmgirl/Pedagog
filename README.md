CIS 642 Project

The goal of this Pedogogial Preview Extension is to provide lower level coders with a
 visualization of the errors in their code. To do this debug information is gathered 
 and presented to the user in a second, required, preview window.

Python Tutor Extraction proto-type

In order to run our extension launch a debug window using the Launch Extension option
 in the debug menu then activate the debug readme.md option from the debug menu. A 
 Webview should apear on the right in the second window. 

The extension.js file is our most heavily edited file as it holds our Webview and extension checking.
